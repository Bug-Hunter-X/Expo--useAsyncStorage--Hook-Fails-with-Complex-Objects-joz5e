This bug occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook with a complex object. If the object contains nested objects or arrays, the hook may fail to properly store or retrieve the data, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is particularly noticeable when dealing with large or deeply nested objects.  The error messages are often cryptic, and debugging can be challenging. For instance, attempting to store a large object may result in a silent failure, leaving the state unchanged, while retrieving the data may yield an empty object or throw an error.
